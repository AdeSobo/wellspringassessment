ASSESSMENT

Time: 3hrs 46Mins

This was completly done without a framework. Just plain Php OOP, Html and Jquery and MySQL

I used a Database because it makes it easier to do CRUD operations

1. unzip file and place in a directory your web server has access to

2. The files contains db.sql, Please run that in your mysql db console or if you use other Sql GUI client application like phpMyadmin

3. Open dbconn.php file and update the database credentials based on your preference.

4. Fire up the index.php file in your browser to test


NOTE: 
- Would have loved to add a routing system in the project but i couldn't due to time constraints.
- Couldn't also get to Unit Testing due to time
- Couldnt also get to setting up env file to store db credentials due to time
